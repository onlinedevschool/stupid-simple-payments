# Dead Simple Hourly Billing

## How simple?

1. Click <create invoice>
2. Select <payee> from the list
3. Enter the rate/hr charges
4. Enter the minutes worked
5. Enter some notes to make this invoice unique and interesting

*done*

An invoice will be saved to your database, and you will be redirected to the invoice listing page where you can see the new invoice along with the top 15 other most recent.

### Then the payee gets an email

Inside is a link to view your invoice. The payee:

1. Opens the email
2. Clicks the invoice link
3. Enters their card info on your SSL page
4. Clicks <pay $xxx.xx>

*done*

They will get an email receipt and you get an email telling you they have paid. It really is that simple.

## Installation (also pretty damn simple!)

### Sign up FREE at Heroku

Go to [https://signup.heroku.com/login](https://signup.heroku.com/login) and create your free account.

You will get an email under the address you registered with Heroku. Open that email now and click the link inside to verify it with Heroku.

### Setup your FREE server (its EASY!)

After clicking that link to confirm your email you were taken to either your dashboard or a page asking to take you to your dashboard:

Your new account is all set up
Click here to proceed as your@email.com

Click that link and proceed to your dashboard.

There are a bunch of icons now before you, but you will not be clicking any of them..... resist thy urges. Instead click the + symbol in the top right.

Leave the name blank, it isn't important unless you are vain, in which case, name it already! ;)

Click <create app>

*done*

### Deploying the Stupid Simple Invoicing app

After the last step you should be on a page with a top bar with stuff like:
